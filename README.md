# Rag_lab_eyoub_beraki_de24
In this lab, I will built a RAG-based chatbot that answers questions using a YouTuber’s course material. Transcripts are chunked and indexed in a vector database for efficient retrieval. A RAG model combines these retrieved segments to generate accurate responses. The system is deployed through a FastAPI backend with a simple chat-based frontend
